# EnderVaults

EnderVaults is available at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ender-vaults.71532/ and https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13074/
You can download it for free aswell as the source.

To start with the plugin just download it from one of those sites and drop into your plugins folder so the plugin can start. Once the plugin has started a config file will generate which will allow you to add/remove vaults and edit the options of each vault,

Thank you, any more questions then contact me at Sunny#4704 (I rarely look at github)
Also plugin has bStats so look at that, I did not upload the plugin name, someone else did and I cba to change the name but all the stats are from my plugin.
